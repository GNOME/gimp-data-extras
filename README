This is the archive of data files for the Gimp.

Contains the latest brushes, gradients, palettes and patterns
by various authors around the internet.

Special thanks to Adrian Likins and #gimp on GimpNet for 
helping me get off my butt and put this stuff together.
GimpNet is a great place to chat about the Gimp, learn new
tricks, etc.  irc.mint.net and irc.canweb.net on port 6666

As of sometime between .11 and .12, gimp-data was split into
gimp-data for essential stuff, and gimp-extras for cool stuff.
